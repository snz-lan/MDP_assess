# MDP Solver: Value Iteration Algorithm

This package implements the Value Iteration algorithm to solve Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).

## Overview

The package allows you to define an MDP by specifying its states, actions, transition probabilities, and rewards. It includes:
- An implementation of the value iteration algorithm.
- An example (based on Example 9.27) modeling Sam's weekend decision between partying and relaxing.
- Unit tests to ensure correctness.

## Installation
